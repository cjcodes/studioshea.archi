          <p>
            For more than a decade, I have been fortunate to have had an
            expansive and varied career path. Having been educated and trained
            in New York City, my experience is rooted in an understanding of how
            to work within a dense urban context. In time, opportunity led me
            across the country to San Francisco, California, which truly
            fostered the flexibility required to work across jurisdictions with
            vastly different regulations and design considerations. This helped
            to build my confidence when relocating again, this time to the U.K.,
            and despite not yet holding local qualifications, I soon found
            myself in a well-appointed role working on complex projects. The
            practical experience I gained was foundational to understanding how
            to practise in the U.K., though after some time, I felt I needed to
            formally (re)acquire the title I’d worked so hard to earn abroad.
            This endeavour required a dedicated focus on preparing for and
            sitting an examination with the ARB, in which I was ultimately
            successful.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, I am a registered architect in both the U.K. and multiple
            U.S. states with a total of eleven years of experience, more than
            four of which were gained post-qualification. My overall project
            contributions span many typologies across all project stages,
            largely positioned in roles related to design development, technical
            detailing, construction support, and sustainability administration.
            Most recently, I have worked on several large and complex aviation
            projects for major London-area airports as a multi-package lead
            across RIBA Stages 3 – 5. My focus has now shifted to a 5+ year
            career outlook with an emphasis on increasing project ownership,
            honing my skills and developing new ones, building long-term
            relationships, and meaningfully contributing to the firm’s mission
            and growth trajectory. All project types, scopes, and sectors appeal
            to me and I am able to easily adapt to teams of any size, as well as
            engage comfortably with both consultants and clients alike.

          <h1 class="text-3xl">Why hire an architect?</h1>
          <p>
            Choosing a professional to design and manage your project is one of
            the most important decisions you’ll make. While you have many
            options, a registered architect offers a unique combination of
            skills, protection, and value that no other professional can.
          </p>

          <h2>Legal Protection:</h2>
          <p>
            The term "architect" is legally protected in the UK by the
            Architects Registration Board (ARB). This guarantees a strict level
            of professional competence, ethical conduct, and mandatory
            professional indemnity insurance. Your project is backed by a
            recognized professional with a duty of care to you, the client.
          </p>

          <h2>Comprehensive Expertise:</h2>
          <p>
            Our training isn’t limited to design. We are uniquely skilled to
            navigate the entire project lifecycle — from initial concept and
            planning applications to detailed technical design and on-site
            project management. We act as your single point of contact, ensuring
            a seamless process from start to finish.
          </p>

          <h2>Unmatched Value:</h2>
          <p>
            An architect’s value is often measured in the problems they prevent,
            not just the beauty they create. By anticipating issues, managing
            your budget, and ensuring a high-quality build, we help you avoid
            costly mistakes and unlock the full potential of your property.
          </p>

          <h2>Your Trusted Advisor:</h2>
          <p>
            We are your advocate throughout the entire process. Our role is to
            listen to your needs, translate them into a buildable design, and
            then manage the team of contractors and consultants required to
            bring that design to life.
